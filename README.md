## Go-Home
A TUI that believes that the only thing that matters is the next 7 days. Go-Home was created and designed
with the idea that most of the time we don't need to know what happens in the next 2 months or 3 weeks, we
just need to know what I need to do today and a bit into the future.

Using the power of Go and [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) we have in our hands
a simple way to check up on, lightly edit, and delete events all within the wonderful world of the terminal.

## Note

go-home is starting to solidify, but again is still needs polish.
